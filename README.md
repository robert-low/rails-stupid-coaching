# Stupid Coaching

~ This is a recreation based on a Rails tutorial at Le Wagon, for teaching beginner programmers. ~

### Ask the Coach a question, and you will receive a very basic response:

- If the message is _'I am going to work'_, the coach will answer **'Great!'**
- If the message has a question mark _'?'_ at the end, the coach will answer **'Silly question, get dressed and go to work!'**
- _Otherwise_ the coach will answer **'I don't care, get dressed and go to work!'**
