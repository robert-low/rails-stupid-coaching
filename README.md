# Stupid Coaching

~ This is a recreation based on a Rails tutorial at Le Wagon, for teaching beginner programmers. ~

Ask the Coach a question, and you will receive a very basic response:

If the message is I am going to work, the coach will answer 'Great!'
If the message has a question mark ? at the end, the coach will answer 'Silly question, get dressed and go to work!'.
Otherwise the coach will answer 'I don't care, get dressed and go to work!'
