# Stupid Coaching

_This is a recreation based on a Rails tutorial at Le Wagon, which I have coded again, for teaching beginner programmers._

### Ask the Coach a question, and you will receive a very basic response:

- If the message is _'I am going to work'_, the coach will answer **'Great!'**
- If the message has a question mark _'?'_ at the end, the coach will answer **'Silly question, get dressed and go to work!'**
- _Otherwise_ the coach will answer **'I don't care, get dressed and go to work!'**
